# mvs_calib0 #

__NOTE__: This ROS package is supposed to hold the calibration results of the real robots. 

The only reason for this package being a GitHub repository is for conveniently sharing across robots and machines. 

However, we are not saying that different robots should share the same calibration. Please create separate folders under the `calib` directory to hold the calibration results for different robots/purposes.

This repository could be used for sharing calibration results between a robot and a standalone machine where the developers are doing development and need to have the same calibration information for some specific robot.

Again, it is just for convenience, use this repository carefully and be good to other team members by __NOT__ overriding their calibration results!
